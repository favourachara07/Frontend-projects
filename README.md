### What I learned

I was able to strengthen my memory and my mind on the creation of this boxes that are used from Shopping platforms to other areas

```html
<div class="qr_container">
    <div class="qr_box">
      <div class="qr_img"><img src="images/image-qr-code.png" alt=""></div>
      <div class="text">Improve your front-end skills by building projects
        <p>Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
```
```css
.qr_container {

    position: fixed;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    display: flex;
}

.qr_box {
    margin: auto auto auto auto;
    border: 2px solid rgb(255, 252, 252);
    border-radius: 20px;
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    width: 16.5rem;
    position: relative;
    text-align: center;
    color: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
    box-shadow: 0px 9px 17px 0px hsla(219, 15%, 55%, 0.274);
    padding-bottom: 2.5rem;
}
}
```

### Continued development

I wish to become better and more experienced in the making of resusable CSS classes to make my css codes more simplified and shortened for my benefit. I also wish to know what CSS properties will best be assigned for a task

### Useful resources

- [Visual Studio Code and it extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com) - This application and its packages helped me to organize my code. I also liked this application and will always use it going forward.
